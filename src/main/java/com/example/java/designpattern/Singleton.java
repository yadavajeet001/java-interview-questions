/**
 * The Singleton Method Design Pattern ensures a class has only one instance

 * Itâ€™s ideal for scenarios requiring centralized control, like managing database connections or configuration settings.
 * This pattern is often used in situations like logging, managing connections to hardware or databases,
 * caching data, or handling thread pools, where having just one instance makes sense
